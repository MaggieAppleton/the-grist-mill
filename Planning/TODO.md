# Human Todo List

- [] Make sure Max HN items is only defined in one place. Currently in both the collector and the local .env file.
- [] Check where we're defining the keywords that we use to filter HN items for. Are these stored in the database?
- [] Review how highlighting system works â€“ how are these items processed once they're scored high
- [] Quality check which HN items are being ranked as highly relevant. Review the prompt that it's evaluating them with
- [] How are we handling fetching new items and saving them to the database? Are we keeping old items? Where in the interface can we see historical / old items? Need to add the concept of time to the dashboard.
